# Key Features:
- **Gamified Learning**  
   Through the gameplay, students will be exposed to problems which can be solved using programming concepts such as “if-else” statements, “for” and “while” loops. 

- **Simulation of Code**  
   Students will be able to see their code in action! Through the game simulation, the students can better understand the logic of the code blocks they have created
---

Through fun and interactive gameplay, we hope that FarmLogic can help children who are new to programming understand and learn to apply the basics of programming while having fun.
